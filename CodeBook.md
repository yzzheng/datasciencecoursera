###Dataset observations(row labels):
====================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers(subjects). Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist with its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to capture the sensor signals. 

###Dataset variables(columns): 
==============================

The variables selected for this database come from the sensor signals captured from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

###Overall dataset cleaning and transformation:
===============================================

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data(7352 observations) and 30% the test data(2947 observations). The complete list features 561 variables. After running the R script, subsetting the dataset, 81 variables left each represents mean or std for each measurement. After merging the 2 datasets, averaging of each variable for each activity and each subject, 180 unique observations/rows left for the dataset. Finally, the tidy dataset is a dataframe of 180 observations(rows) and 81 variables(column).
